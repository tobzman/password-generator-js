# week-3-Passwordgenerator.

Description

This is a simple web-based application that generates a random password based on the user's specified criteria. It includes an HTML file (index.html), a CSS file (style.css), and a JavaScript file (script.js).
Installation

To run the code, simply download the files and open the index.html file in a web browser.
Usage

Upon opening the index.html file, the user will see a button labeled "Generate Password." When the user clicks the button, the application will prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password, as well as the inclusion of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The application will then generate a random password and display it in a text area labeled "Your Secure Password."
